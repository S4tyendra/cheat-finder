Understanding Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks

AI systems are revolutionizing how we approach complex problems. Machine learning, a key component of AI, enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming.

Neural networks, which are modeled after biological brains, form the foundation of deep learning. These networks excel at pattern recognition and data processing tasks.

The applications of AI technology span multiple sectors, including healthcare analytics, financial forecasting, and computer vision systems.
