The Rise of Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the approach to tackling difficult problems. Machine learning, an essential part of AI, allows computers to learn from data without explicit instructions.

Neural networks, designed to mimic biological brains, are central to deep learning. These networks are particularly effective at recognizing patterns and processing data.

AI technologies are used across different industries, including healthcare analytics, financial predictions, and computer vision applications.
