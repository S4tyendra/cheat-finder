Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn and improve from experience. These systems can identify patterns in data and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Deep learning, a specialized form of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. These networks can process vast amounts of data and learn complex patterns.

Key applications of machine learning include image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. These technologies are transforming industries from healthcare to finance.
